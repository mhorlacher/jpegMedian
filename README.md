Given a sequence of stationary images (JPEG) of a stationary background with moving objects, the script attempts to extract the 
background image by calculating the pixel-wise median across all images and color chanels. This script is meant as a proof of 
concept, space-consumption and rumtime are not feasible for real-world images of several megabites.
